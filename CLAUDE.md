# Development Instructions for zotero-tag-automation

<!-- SKILL-WORKFLOW-START -->
## Skill Development Workflow

This project follows the standardized skill workflow. The skill files are in the `skill/` subfolder, which is symlinked to `~/.claude/skills/zotero-tag-automation/`.

### Important Rules

1. **Only edit files in the `skill/` folder** - Never edit `~/.claude/skills/` directly (it's a symlink to this folder)
2. **Update README.md** if functionality changes
3. **Ask user to review changes** before committing
4. **Commit and push** after user approval (if remote exists)

### File Structure

```
